## Annafi FlipSide Poltiical Melding Site

![The Flip Side](https://csmooth.github.io/theflipside/assets/flipside-full-logo.png)

The Flip Side is a daily production by Annafi Wahed in which authors from liberal and conservative backgrounds read the news and report back from both perspectives. The production currently exists as an email newsletter, and Annafi is looking to port over subscriptions from the default Mailchimp site. As of July 2017, the site is built with plain html, css and javascript. The site is live on [Github Pages](https://csmooth.github.io/theflipside/index.html#).

Remaining To-Do's:
- Connect MailChimp to Subscribe Form
- Migrate Archive to in-site "Archives" page
- Routing

Dependencies:
- [Google Web Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (Oswald, Merriweather)
- [Fonts2U](https://fonts2u.com/oswaldstencil-bold.font) (Oswald-Stencil)

## Extras:
While this is an independent project, the web creator Christian Smith is happy to contribute towards something aimed at bridging the political divide. See earlier efforts by the developer [here](https://github.com/firesidechat/fireside-ui) and [demo here](https://firesidechat.github.io/fireside-ui/).

As mentioned, the site is built in plain html/css/js for simplicity and proof of concept.

The social media icons are built with path svg's.
